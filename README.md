# **Working with Tkinter in Python**  
This notebook offers a hands-on introduction to building graphical user interfaces (GUIs) in Python using the Tkinter library. It covers the basics of creating windows, adding widgets (like buttons, labels, and entry fields), handling user events, and organizing layouts with `pack`, `grid`, and `place`.  

Designed for beginners, itâ€™s ideal for anyone getting started with desktop applications, automation tools, or interactive programs in Python. All examples run directly in Jupyter Notebook, making it easy to experiment and learn step by step.  

A practical foundation for creating simple GUIs before moving on to more complex applications with databases, file handling, or external APIs.
